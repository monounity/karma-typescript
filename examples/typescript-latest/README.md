# Runnable example of unit testing Typescript on the fly in Karma with Istanbul coverage

## Installation

### Example code breakdown
The `hello.component.spec.ts` unit test showcases module loading by using `import` but is still as simple as it gets;
it imports the class to be tested and an interface required by the class.
The interface is mocked, the class is instantiated and then the method `sayHello` is tested:

```javascript
import { HelloService } from "./hello-service.interface";
import { HelloComponent } from "./hello.component";

class MockHelloService implements HelloService {

    public sayHello(): string {
        return "hello world!";
    }
}

describe('HelloComponent', () => {

    it("should say 'hello world!'", () => {

        let mockHelloService = new MockHelloService();
        let helloComponent = new HelloComponent(mockHelloService);

        expect(helloComponent.sayHello()).toEqual("hello world!");
    });
});
```
